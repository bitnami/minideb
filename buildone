# Build a minideb image
#
# First we build the image as a tarball, then we import it and tag it.
#
# However we aim to allow our images to be reproduced. That means
# we need more control over the import process. We also build and import
# each image twice to confirm that our images are still reproducible.
#
# To reproduce an image you have to:
#
#   - Produce exactly the same base tarball. `mkimage` will take care of that
#     for the same package inputs.
#   - Import the image with the same config (`CMD` etc.)
#   - Have the same creation date on the image.
#
# That last requirement leads us to some extra work to re-use timestamps.
#
# The steps are:
#
# 1. Pull image from Dockerhub and save creation date and image_id
# 2. Build image locally and import it, setting creation date to the pulled one
# 3. Build the image again and import it, also setting creation date to the pulled one
# 4. Compare the built image ids. Error if they are not the same (Docker thinks images are different, thanks to checksum)
# 5. Compare built image id with pulled image id. Both will have same creation date but may differ in checksum so ids may be different
#    - If the image is the same as the pulled one then nothing changed in this build
#    - If the image differs from the pulled one then:
#      - Re-import the locally built image with the current timestamp so it will be shown as a new image
#      - Tag the built image with the target tag, ready to push.
